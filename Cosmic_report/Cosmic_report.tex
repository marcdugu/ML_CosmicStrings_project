\begin{abstract}
    The detection of cosmic strings is important because reasons \C{why do we want them?}. 
    The search for these comsic strings is being held back by detector glitches.
    These glithces can strongly resemble comsic strings. 
    It is therefore very important to develop a method of distinguishing between a cosmic string signal and a glitch.
    In the work we focus on using a neural network for this task.

\section{Introduction}
% A very general introduction
The first detected gravitational wave (GW) signal was GW150914\cite{PhysRevLett116061102} in 2015. 
These GW signals can originate from several sources, one of which is cosmic strings.
Since the first observed GW many technological advancements have been made, yet one thing that still plagues detectors is the presence glitches.    
These are bursts of non-Gaussian noise that look like a signal \C{Needs citation}.
These glitches can be mistaken for a signal, so it is important to find a way to distinguish between a signal and a glitch.
In this work we focus on the use of machine learning to distinguish between a glitch and a signal.

\subsection{Cosmic strings and glitches}
% A deep dive into cosmic srings
Cosmic strings are one-dimensional topological defects and originate form field theories~\cite{Meijer_2024}.
These defects could have formed from spontanious symmetry breaking in the early universe~\cite{schmitz2024gravitationalwavescosmicstrings}.
These cosmic strings are of interest since they affect our understanding of physics, and can help confirm or rule out centrain physics models. \\
\indent
Cosmic strings appear at cosmological scales as thin strings with large densities, and their motion is well described by the Nambu-Goto action~\cite{MairiSakellariadou}.
Cosmic stings can both be open strings or closed loops, and two cosmic strings are able to interact with eachother. \C{Needs citation}\\
\indent
To detect cosmic strings we first need to understand what a GW signal with a cosmic string source looks like.
Cosmic strings can produce GW signals in multiple ways. Examples include the formation of cusps and kinks~\cite{PhysRevLett126241102}. 
Here we will focus on the cusps. A cusp is a singularity, where a point traveling along the curve would have to turn around.
When this occurs, the physical string snaps into a cusp shape, and is instantaniously accelerated to the speed of light at that point.
A burst GW is then emitted in the direction of acceleration~\cite{Meijer_2024}.
Such a signal can be seen in the left plot in figure~\ref{CS_signal_and_glitch}.\\

    \label{CS_signal_and_glitch}
\end{figure}
\indent
Whith the knowledge of what the signal looks like, the next step is to search for a signal.
The problem with this is that the form of the signal is very similar to that of centrain glitches, like the blip glitch.
Blib glitches are short noise transients with a large frequency bandwidth~\cite{Cabero_2019}. 
The form of this glitch can be seen in the right plot in figure figure~\ref{CS_signal_and_glitch}\\
\indent
Since a GW signal from cosmic strings can be so similar to glitches, it is crucial to develop a method to distinguish between them.
